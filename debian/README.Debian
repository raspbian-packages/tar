The options -Z, --compress, and --uncompress all require that there be a
'compress' utility installed on the system.  If there is no compress installed
on your system, you will get errors if you try to use these options to tar.  

While the algorithm used by compress was originally encumbered by patents, 
enough time has passed that 'ncompress' is now available in Debian main.
